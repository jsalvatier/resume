 \section{Open Source}
    {\bf Github account} github.com/jsalvatier 

    \bactivity{\href{https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc\#readme}{PyMC} }{Bayesian inference package (Python)}{10-current}
      \item Overhauled likelihood calculation to automatically provide gradients 
      \item Implemented gradient based samplers which scale better with problem size, self-tune, handle difficult distributions well, etc.
      \item Experimented numexpr and Cython code generation for likelihoods
      \item Wrote experimental PyMC 2 replacement with dramatically simpler and smaller codebase, which will soon replace PyMC 2 and become PyMC 3
